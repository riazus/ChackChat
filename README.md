# ChackChat

Hello everyone! This is a small messenger in c# based on wcf

Its capabilities are small, for example, it can send messages to a "big chat" where all connected users can see it.

It is also possible to connect MS SQL databases, where all users are registered.

If you clone it, you will only be able to communicate over a local network. In order for it to work in the global one, you need to register some commands in the Host config, about which I will leave a note there.

For me, this is just a learning project that allowed me to get acquainted with wonderful opportunities .NET and SQL bases.

I will be glad if you leave feedback.

You can find me in the slack of school 21 under the nickname 'jannabel' or write to the mail usmanovriaz2003@mail.ru

I wish you a pleasant acquaintance with this application!
